## Canary jobs

Canary is responsible for smoke testing [participating ClojureScript projects](https://github.com/cljs-oss/canary/tree/master/runner/src/canary/projects) with a pinned ClojureScript version.
You can read more about Canary runner in the [master readme](https://github.com/cljs-oss/canary/tree/master).

You can trigger Canary jobs by committing into this branch. We extract git commit message and use it as command-line arguments to execute your job. 

For example `job` commit message will run a job for bleeding-edge official [ClojureScript master](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/tree/master).

To execute above command personally I would run this from command-line:

```bash
git clone --branch jobs git@github.com:cljs-oss/canary.git
cd canary
git commit --allow-empty -m "job"
git push
```

The commit can be empty and the message is [expected](https://github.com/cljs-oss/canary/blob/3a555f984f27dea52af2d756df28647af208b08d/scripts/travis-entrypoint.sh#L16) 
to contain command-line arguments you would normally use `job [action] [arg1] [arg2] [...]`.

Each completed job should finally commit a report page with results. You can find archived reports in the [results branch](https://github.com/cljs-oss/canary/tree/results).
